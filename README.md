- The four scripts contain the code used to train the models and perform calculations as explained in "Exploring machine learning techniques for estimating downstream indirect land use changes in Life Cycle Assessment". An account in Google Earth Engine (GEE) is required to run the code.
Copy the content of each script in the GEE editor and <run>.

- For computations with local computer, a sample is presented in "data sample" folder. Run sampling.js to create more training samples as csv files.

The Neural Networks were implemented using a Jupyter in a [Google Colab environment](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Hk79bEG5bPaL9YJDvtHZvhpbBYH9W7LU?usp=sharing)
